Features

>>>>>>> c4e768d0a87cac02023d075447e3c3a79a8e2575
Smart bins with dynamic fill levels (0â€“100%).

Waste truck collects bins only if fill level > 85%.

Shortest path calculation using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.

Tracks total distance, time, and fuel consumption.

Console simulation with real-time style updates.
